            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                At Price Ahead, our journey began with a simple observation – the prices for sporting events
                were not always reflective of the conditions, and fan attendance suffered as a result. We noticed
                that, even in adverse weather conditions, ticket prices remained high, leading to suboptimal attendance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Determined to address this issue, we embarked on a mission to create an innovative solution.
                Price Ahead was born from the desire to empower price setters with valuable insights into how
                weather conditions impact fan engagement. Our app utilizes historical data and cutting-edge weather
                analytics to provide accurate predictions on how different weather scenarios might affect specific
                fan bases.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Price Ahead, we aim to revolutionize the ticket pricing landscape for sports events,
                ensuring that prices are not only fair but also responsive to the external factors that matter most
                to fans. Join us on our journey to create a more dynamic and fan-friendly sports ticketing experience.
